This is a test post to demonstrate math equation rendering with KaTeX.

## Inline Math

The quadratic formula is $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$ and it's very useful.

Einstein's famous equation is $E = mc^2$, which shows the equivalence of mass and energy.

## Display Math

Here's the Pythagorean theorem displayed:

$$
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
$$

The sum of a geometric series:

$$
S_n = a \cdot \frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r}
$$

## More Complex Examples

Euler's identity is often cited as the most beautiful equation in mathematics:

$$
e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0
$$

The Fourier transform:

$$
F(\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(t) e^{-i\omega t} dt
$$

## Matrix Example

A simple matrix:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
a & b \\
c & d
\end{bmatrix}
$$

That's it! Math rendering is working perfectly with both inline and display equations.
